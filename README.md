# SethPortfolio
Capstone Project | Seth iOS Portfolio

2 Files in Repo:

SethPortfolio.xcodeproj is shown as a folder, but if opened on a macbook with Xcode it opens the project file with all the items.

SethPortfolio Folder is the assets folder that has all the swift files class files, graphics assets and audio files.

I organized the project in a Model View Controller pattern. Model folder holds all data used in the View-Controllers, View Controller contains all code associated with the user view.

Please see swift files for the source code.
